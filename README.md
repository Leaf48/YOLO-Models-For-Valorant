## We are looking for anyone who is willing and able to contribute to the datasets.
## If you can, I would like you to label "enemy.", no need to label "teammate" or anything else.
## And Please label "enemy" from the knees to the top of the head.

### Krunker
krunker.pt was trained in YoloV5s and never releases again.

### Valorant-bot
Valorant-bot was trained for Training Ground(Valorant) and it never releases again.

### Valorant-v
Valorant-v.pt was trained in YoloV5s.
I highly recommend that you use **valorant-v8.pt**.
It's slower than **Valorant-n**. But It's enough to kill enemy.

### Valorant-n
Valorant-n.pt was trained in YoloV5n.
It's very quick to respond. But sometimes it doesn't respond to enemies.
