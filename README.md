## Krunker
krunker.pt was trained in YoloV5s and never releases again.

## Valorant-bot
Valorant-bot was trained for Training Ground(Valorant) and it never releases again.

## Valorant-v
Valorant-v.pt was trained in YoloV5s.
I highly recommend that you use **valorant-v8.pt**.
It's slower than **Valorant-n**. But It's enought to kill enemy.

## Valorant-n
Valorant-n.pt was trained in YoloV5n.
It's very quickly to response. But sometimes it doesn't response to enemy.
